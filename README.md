## 'Self-organising Teams' ABM

I have created this agent-based model (ABM) to demonstrate how teams can effectively 'self organise' and how, under certain conditions, this bottom-up organisation can be far more effective than top-down project management.  

The necessary conditions include: 
- Team members must have a well defined and achievable objective.
- Team members must be empowered to take autonomous action towards achieving their objective. 
- Individual actions must not prevent other team members from achieving their objective.
- Team members must be able to adapt their actions in response to the actions of others. 

In this ABM, agents are required to select a pair of other agents from the 'room' at random, and their objective is to move themselves into a position that is equidistant from these chosen agents. 

The model will run until all agents have either acheived this objective, within a reasonable margin of error, or have no valid moves available to them.
